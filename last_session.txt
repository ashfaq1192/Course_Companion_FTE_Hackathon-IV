● I have a good understanding of the hackathon. It's about building a Course Companion FTE (Full-Time Equivalent) - an
  AI educational tutor with:

  3 Phases:
  - Phase 1: Zero-Backend-LLM architecture (ChatGPT App + Deterministic FastAPI backend)
  - Phase 2: Hybrid Intelligence (Premium LLM features)
  - Phase 3: Full Web App (Next.js)

  Tech Stack:
  - FastAPI (Python) backend
  - OpenAI Apps SDK for ChatGPT App
  - Next.js/React for Web frontend
  - Cloudflare R2 for storage
  - MCP (Model Context Protocol) for tools
  - Database: Neon/Supabase

  Let me research the latest implementation practices for these technologies.
